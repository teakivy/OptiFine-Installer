# Optifine Installer

This is a simple project I made to install Optifine without having to go through the hassle of going to [optifine.net](https://optifine.net), finding a version, downloading the jar, running it, and installing.

## Installation

> _⚠️ Please note, as of now, Optifine Installer is not signed by Microsoft. This means the first time you run the Setup exe, Windows will prompt you saying it may not be safe. Optifine Installer is **not malicious**, all source code for the project is avaliable in this repository, you are more than welcome to compile it yourself_.
>
> _For anyone who just wants to run an exe from [Releases](https://github.com/teakivy/OptiFine-Installer/releases), click `More Info`, then `Run Anyways`._

Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/teakivy/OptiFine-Installer/releases) page, then run the Setup Installer.

## How to Use

> ⚠️ Make sure you have Java Installed on your machine, this only has to be done once.

-   Run `Optifine Installer.exe`
-   Select your desired Minecraft Version
-   Select which Optifine Jar you want to install
-   Click Install
    -   Optionally, you can hold Shift and click Run Installer to choose where to Install Optifine to by running the default Optifine Installer
